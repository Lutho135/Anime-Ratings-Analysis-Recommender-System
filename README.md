Every streaming content has its own viewers and each content has it's rating. Viewers leave some good ratings for the content if they like it. But where does it apply? Viewers can spend hours scrolling through hundreds, sometimes thousands of anime's but never getting a content they like. Businesses need to provide suggestions based on viewers likings and needs in order to create a better streaming environment that boosts revenue and increases the time spent on a website.
