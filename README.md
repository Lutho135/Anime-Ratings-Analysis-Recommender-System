Overview
Every streaming content has its own viewers and each content has its rating. Viewers leave ratings for the content they like. However, viewers can spend hours scrolling through hundreds, sometimes thousands, of anime titles but never find content they like. Businesses need to provide suggestions based on viewers' likings and needs to create a better streaming environment that boosts revenue and increases the time spent on the website.
